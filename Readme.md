# Dungeon Adventure Reboot

When I first began learning web-development, back when a git meant nothing to me, I built a text-based adventure game. The original can be found in [this repository][original]. From there, I was accepted into appAcademy and the rest is history... well, recent past. In any case, I always wanted to go back and reboot this game and do things the right way, the conventional way, the professional way. It is a good for myself guidepost to appreciate how far I have come in my education and a way for me to appreciate all the work that I put in.

## Better than Better
Enough of that, this new Dungeon Adventure is incomparable to the first. Did you know I naively created my own object Class when I first made the game to make objects? No more! This rebooted adventure is built using the best conventions, and better yet, Test-Driven Development. That's right, I have rebuilt this game with over x amount of tests to really show off what I have learned.

(Once I figure out how I want to get a console like setting up on GitPages I will enumerate on the whole stack)

### Rudimentary To-Do List

- [x] Separate objects into separate classes/files
- [ ] Build out functions and their tests for each object file
- [ ] Rebuild the Player and their functions to be OOP
- [ ] Incorporate the objects into the single Adventure script
- [ ] Build integrated tests for the Adventure
- [ ] Get the Adventure in a Web App
